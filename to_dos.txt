Plan
- - -
1) fix local rails (done)
2) bring whole BE over to new kicks (done)
3) add request specs to new kicks (done)
4) transfer old React Redux app into Vite app and get it working (done)
5) add React specific tests (partially done but moving on due to time)
    What to Test (Priority Order)
        1) Reducers - Easiest to test, pure functions. Start here! (done)
        2) Selectors (done)
        3) Utils - Pure functions (date_util, sort_util) (done)
        4) Simple Components - Presentational components without complex state (done-ish)
        5) Actions - Will need mocking later when you add integration tests
        6) Complex Components - Forms, pages with routing
        7) API Utils - Mock fetch calls (save for integration testing)
    - bring feature specs over?
6) partial upgrade to new Redux Toolkit (done)
    - combine actions and reducers into slices (for backings only)
    
7) create new BE Python API
8) Transition to TypeScript? no






Plan for building py_kicks api

I) Users and Sessions (done)
    - use JWT + local sessionStorage to store session key client-side; sessionStorage persistent upon page refresh
    a. user create, show, and associated views (done)
    b. auth (done)
    c. session create, destroy, show, and associated views (done)
    
    d. FE JWT changes (done)
        i. update FE to sign in and store refresh and access_token (done)
            1. context already logged in (has stored access_token)
                i. actually signed in server side
                ii. not actually signed in server side
            2. not signed in
        ii. attached access token to all requests (done)
        iii. attached refresh token to sign out request (done)
II) Projects
    a. projects all actions
        i. migration
        ii. models
        iii. cv
    b. user show action
        i. created and backed projects serializer
III) Rewards
IV) Backings
V) Search and Discovery

- actually do short cycle access tokens and long-cycle refresh tokens?
- set expiration times in settings for JWT?
