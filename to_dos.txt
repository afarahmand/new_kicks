Plan
- - -
1) fix local rails (done)
2) bring whole BE over to new kicks (done)
3) add request specs to new kicks (done)
4) transfer old React Redux app into Vite app and get it working (done)
5) add React specific tests (partially done but moving on due to time)
    What to Test (Priority Order)
        1) Reducers - Easiest to test, pure functions. Start here! (done)
        2) Selectors (done)
        3) Utils - Pure functions (date_util, sort_util) (done)
        4) Simple Components - Presentational components without complex state (done-ish)
        5) Actions - Will need mocking later when you add integration tests
        6) Complex Components - Forms, pages with routing
        7) API Utils - Mock fetch calls (save for integration testing)
    - bring feature specs over?
6) partial upgrade to new Redux Toolkit (done)
    - combine actions and reducers into slices (for backings only)
    
7) create new BE Python API
8) Transition to TypeScript?
