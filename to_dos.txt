    What to Test (Priority Order)
        1) Reducers - Easiest to test, pure functions. Start here! (done)
        2) Selectors (done)
        3) Utils - Pure functions (date_util, sort_util) (done)
        4) Simple Components - Presentational components without complex state (done-ish)
        5) Actions - Will need mocking later when you add integration tests
        6) Complex Components - Forms, pages with routing
        7) API Utils - Mock fetch calls (save for integration testing)
    - bring feature specs over?
6) partial upgrade to new Redux Toolkit (done)
    - combine actions and reducers into slices (for backings only)
    
7) create new BE Python API
8) Transition to TypeScript? no
